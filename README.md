# ERT
Etymological Roots Tool - using machine learning to visualize the origin of words

Welcome to the ERT project. The goal at this point is to explore the English language and its history to find where words actually stem from. ERT uses machine learning to find the historical origins of English words and displays a tree graph of its roots via a web application.
